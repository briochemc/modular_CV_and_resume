\section{Summary}
%-------------------------------------

I am a researcher with expertise in multiple disciplines, including mathematics, computational science, oceanography, and finance.
I have experience with running and diagnosing ocean and climate models, developing biogeochemistry models, parameter optimisation, and analysing large datasets.
To support my scientific enquiries, I have developed several open-source scientific software packages.
I have an excellent publication record and presented my work at local and international conferences.
I am also passionate about education despite limited opportunities for teaching.

In the last few years, I have been investigating the ocean's response to global warming.
Today, I would like to put my skills at the service of the fight against climate change by contributing to the development of science-based innovative solutions and strategies.
